# Polymer.ai

## Overview
A polyworking platform that enables users to manage multiple side hustles simultaneously through AI-powered tools: canvas builder, fake user simulation, SOP mapping, employee modeling, and business simulation.

## Problem Statement
Managing multiple side projects or businesses is complex. People need to validate ideas, document processes, and simulate operations without actually hiring or spending money on each venture.

## Target Audience
- Solo entrepreneurs
- Portfolio career professionals
- Side hustlers
- Indie makers
- Consultants managing multiple clients

## Core Features
- **Talk-to-Canvas Builder**: Voice/chat to visual business canvas
- **Fake User Simulator**: AI personas to test product ideas and get feedback
- **SOP Mapper**: Generate and document standard operating procedures
- **Employee Simulator**: Model team roles and workflows without hiring
- **Business Simulator**: Run scenarios and projections for each venture
- Dashboard to manage multiple projects
- Time allocation and switching between projects
- Progress tracking across ventures

## Value Proposition
Run multiple businesses in parallel with AI teammates - validate ideas, build processes, and simulate operations before investing real resources.

## Technical Approach
- LLM for conversational interfaces and persona simulation
- Canvas/visual editor for business modeling
- Process flow builder for SOPs
