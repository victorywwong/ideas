# Alpha School

## Overview
A learning platform that enables students of all ages to learn through building projects with AI assistants and human classmates, fostering collaborative, project-based education.

## Problem Statement
Traditional education often separates students by age and uses passive learning methods. Real-world skills require hands-on building and collaboration across experience levels, which current platforms don't facilitate effectively.

## Target Audience
- Students of all ages (kids through adults)
- Self-directed learners
- Project-based learning enthusiasts
- Homeschooling families
- Lifelong learners

## Core Features
- AI-assisted project building tools
- Multi-age peer collaboration spaces
- Project templates across domains (coding, art, science, etc.)
- Real-time collaboration with AI and human mentorship
- Portfolio building for completed projects
- Adaptive difficulty based on age and skill level

## Value Proposition
Learn by doing with personalized AI support while collaborating with peers of any age, breaking down traditional classroom barriers.

## Technical Approach
- LLM integration for personalized tutoring and project guidance
- Real-time collaborative editing environment
- Age-appropriate content filtering and safety controls
- Progress tracking and adaptive curriculum
- Community features (forums, project sharing, peer review)

## Market Analysis
### Competitors
- Khan Academy (video-based, less collaborative)
- Codecademy (coding-only, limited AI)
- ClassDojo (K-8 focused)
- Discord/Slack learning communities (unstructured)

### Business Model
- Freemium model
- Premium features for advanced AI tutoring
- Institutional licensing for schools/programs

## Next Steps
- [ ] Define initial project categories
- [ ] Research child safety and COPPA compliance
- [ ] Prototype AI tutor interaction model
- [ ] Survey potential users (students, parents, educators)
