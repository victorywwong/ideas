# Book to App

## Overview
Translate self-help and educational books like "Atomic Habits" or "Peak: Science of Expertise" into interactive web applications that help users apply the concepts.

## Problem Statement
Reading books provides knowledge, but applying that knowledge consistently is hard. People need structured tools and reminders to turn book concepts into habits and actions.

## Target Audience

- People who buy books but struggle to apply them
- Productivity seekers
- Lifelong learners
- Coaches and mentors

## Core Features
- Book-specific interactive modules
- Daily/weekly exercises based on book frameworks
- Progress tracking and habit formation
- Personalized applications of concepts
- Reflection prompts and journaling
- Community of people applying same book
- Integration with books:
  - Atomic Habits: habit tracking and stacking
  - Peak: deliberate practice tracking
  - Deep Work: focus session management
  - Getting Things Done: task management system

## Value Proposition
Don't just read about habits and expertise - actually build them with an app designed around proven frameworks from the books you love.

## Technical Approach
- Framework extraction from books (manual curation initially)
- Web app templates per book methodology
- Habit tracking and reminder system
